usually watch them in the evenings at home for about 1â€“2 hours, making sure I have no distractions so I can focus properly.

am practising coding regularly and making sure I complete the weekly practicals on time. This helps me reinforce the concepts.

I need to avoid leaving tasks to the last minute. Sometimes I delay starting assignments, which adds unnecessary stress.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

sometimes rush through the practicals without fully reviewing my code or reflecting on alternative solutions. I will take more time to test and review.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am good at applying the lecture content to the practicals and making sure my code runs correctly. I also use comments and good formatting, which makes my work clearer.
